# Project Title
Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

# Project Description
This project predicts the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using a Random Forest Classifier.
The model is trained on a wine quality dataset and evaluated using accuracy score.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

# Dataset
The dataset contains various chemical features of wine such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH.
The target variable is `quality`, which represents the quality score of the wine.

# Steps Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Data visualization
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy score
- Prediction on new input data

# Machine Learning Model
- Random Forest Classifier

# How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Modify input values to test predictions

# Open in Google Colab

# Output
The model predicts the quality of wine based on input features and provides an accuracy score for evaluation.

# Conclusion
Random Forest Classifier provides good accuracy for predicting wine quality and helps understand feature importance.
